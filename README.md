# Capstone-Project
In this capstone project, I have solved a real-world ML problem by building, tracking, containerizing, deploying, and monitoring the model using full MLOps practices.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This capstone project demonstrates a real-world, end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline built and deployed using complete MLOps best practices.

The goal was to automate and productionize the ML workflow â€” from data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, to deployment and monitoring â€” using industry-standard tools and services.

The pipeline is:

âœ… Tracked using DVC for data and pipeline versioning

âœ… Logged and monitored via MLflow for experiment tracking

âœ… Containerized using Docker

âœ… Automated with GitHub Actions CI/CD

âœ… Deployed on AWS EKS (Kubernetes)

âœ… Monitored with Prometheus & Grafana

This project represents a complete lifecycle of building and deploying an ML model in a scalable, reproducible, and production-grade setup.
